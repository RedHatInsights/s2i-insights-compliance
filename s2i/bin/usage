This is the s2i-insights-compliance S2I image:
You should not run this image on its own, but use it as a base
s2i image for all Insights compliance-related apps.

First, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Sample invocation:

s2i build /home/dlobatog/workspace/compliance-backend s2i-insights-compliance <application image>

This will create an image with the source from compliance-backend, and the
tools in s2i/bin located on /usr/libexec/s2i.

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -e APPLICATION_TYPE=prometheus-exporter -p 127.0.0.1:9394:9394 <application image>
or
docker run -e APPLICATION_TYPE=consumer <application image>
or
docker run -e APPLICATION_TYPE=backend -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 <application image>
